BQF // some functions for the calculation and reduction of binary quadratic forms (over Z), computation of the class group for a particular discriminant, and an application to factoring over Z.

Characters // implementations of various techniques from computational group theory, comprising an implementation of the Schreier-Sims algorithm to efficiently generate a matrix subgroup given a set of generators; compute conjugacy classes of such subgroups; find structure constants; and produce the character table of a (finite, moduolo p) matrix group using Burnside's algorithm.

Primepolys // some number theoretic concepts; explores the question of computing first square roots ten general polynomial roots modulo p, for p prime.
