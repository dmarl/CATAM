Just some uploads from my 2017 Cambridge mathematics Part II CATAM computational coursework, in Python.

BQF - some functions for the calculation and reduction of binary quadratic forms (over $$\mathbb{Z}$$), computation of the class group for a particular discriminant, and an application to factoring over $$\mathbb{Z}$$.

Characters - implementations of various techniques from computational group theory, comprising an implementation of the Schreier-Sims algorithm to efficiently generate a matrix subgroup given a set of generators; compute conjugacy classes of such subgroups; find structure constants; and produce the character table of a (finite, modulo p) matrix group using Burnside's algorithm.

Primepolys - explores the question of computing general polynomial roots modulo p, for p prime.
